## Motivation

`revq` was born out of a desire to learn Rust programming and improve upon a simple bash script created by my [mentor](https://github.com/puzzledvacuum).

`revq` offers several advantages over similar tools like `gh pr`:
- Can be run from any directory in your terminal
- Allows filtering of pull requests based on author and organization
- Enables selection and opening of multiple PRs simultaneously
- Written in Rust for performance and reliability

## Future Work

We have exciting plans for future enhancements to `revq`:

- [ ] Allow filtering by mentions
- [ ] Allow filtering by assignees
- [ ] Support for multiple organizations
